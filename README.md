Experiment 3: API Data Integration
Objective
Integrate weather data from a public API with a sample sales dataset to analyze the impact of weather on sales. The project demonstrates fetching, transforming, and storing weather data alongside sales records.
Files in this Repository
sales_weather_integration.py : Python script to load sales data, fetch weather data for each city, merge it with sales, and save the combined dataset.
sales_data.xlsx : Sample sales dataset with columns sale_id, customer_id, city, product, quantity, unit_price, and sale_date.
sales_with_weather.xlsx : Output dataset generated by the script, combining sales data with weather information (created after running the script).
README.md : This file explaining the project, files, and usage.
Requirements
Python 3
Packages: pandas, requests, openpyxl
How to Run
Place sales_data.xlsx and sales_weather_integration.py in the same folder.
Open sales_weather_integration.py and replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your OpenWeatherMap API key.
Run the Python script in your preferred Python environment.
The merged dataset will be saved as sales_with_weather.xlsx.
